# About Me
![visitors](https://vbr.wocr.tk/badge?page_id=ChevalMonsieur.ChevalMonsieur&color=00cf00) <br> <br>
üëã Hey people, My name is Justin Hurson, even if Github knows me as ``ChevalMonsieur``. I'm a student in computer science at the <i>IUT de Bordeaux</i> (France),
where I'm in 2nd year of a bachelor's degree. 
<br><br>üíª I work a lot on solo projects, that turn out very frequently to be ``game dev projects``. At the moment, I have 2 projects on the table, a spaceship and a car game.
If you want to see what I do, have a look at my <a href="https://mrcheval.itch.io" target="_blank"> <b>Itch.io</b></a> page to test some of the games I create in my free time.
<br><br>üåçI am currently looking for an ``internship`` abroad of 8 to 10 weeks, the countries where I would love to make my internship are the <b>USA</b>, <b>Canada</b> and <b>Australia</b>.
An internship in <b>Japan</b> would also be great but I can only speak English.
<br><br> üì´ Feel free to contact me (bottom page) if ever you feel interested in taking me in your company, or for any other reason !

# My work 

### <a href="https://github.com/Kamizzs/JeuJK" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù> Death Grips </a> aka my first game :
````
- I love it
- I made all the code except for the menu
- It's a simple platformer that has 5 to 10 minutes of gameplay (so try it out on itch.io)
````

<br>

### <a href="https://mrcheval.itch.io/spacefastthingxtreme2ultra" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù> Space Fast Thing Xtreme 2 Ultra </a> a game with a very serious title :
````
- You really should pilot a space ship once (it's not as easy as you think)
- There are 4 maps, some AI, and even bad shader I made
- I made everything by myself
- It's on Itch.io
````

<br>

### You should really give a look at <a href="https://github.com/ChevalMonsieur/HyperstellarHappyCorporateScienceSpaceStation" target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù> HyperStellar Happy Corporate Science Space Station </a> :
````
- it's a board game adapted to computer
- it has 'beautiful' pixelart (made with love by me)
- I worked hard on it with 3 other students
- It's a school project, for once !
````
